What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project? 
	
 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
	Fighting gross sickness things and collecting vitamins. I think it reflects well.
 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
	Multiple ways to go through a level.
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
	It seems all the plans you have listed are good ways to improve. I think, making the enemies'
	HP clearer would help. And adjusting the speed of the enemies compared to bullets, as they can 
	sometimes outrun them.
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
	Not really.
 

Is it clear that every group member participated? 
	Yes
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE? 
	Yes
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
	Maybe a thumbnail to spice it up?
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
	It's lovely! Especially with only three members. The code is well-organized
	and follows some good conventions. Good job!
