What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

 I learned that variety of movements are important!

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

 The game reflects the theme by attacking germs.

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

 I would like to implement the game's variety of movement such as timed jump. Short presses for short jump and long presses for long jumps.

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

 This game was already pretty awesome. One suggestion I have would be to have a smooth, slower transition to the end screen instead of an abrupt change of scene.

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 The MainMenu scene has an empty script. Was this on purpose?

Is it clear that every group member participated?

 It is clear every group member participated from the GithHub commits.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 It has the appropriate license but every member should sign it.

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 The README could use GitHub markup for a more aesthetic formatting. It also needs screenshots.

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

 This is the best game I've reviewed for the class. Great job!
